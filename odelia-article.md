    This TechCrunch article is about Sunroom, a new social media app aiming to address the
heavy content moderation many women and non-binary content creators face on popular social
media apps, such as Instagram by building a more open-minded platform where creators,
only women and non-binary creators as of now, can profit off their work. As the article
notes, Sunroom “isn’t trying to make another OnlyFans”. Instead, they hope to make a social
media platform with limited censorship, where women and non-binary people can break down
stigmas to profit off their creative work. The app has only 100 content creators as of its
launch, and hopes to scale slowly to keep hands-on moderation and censorship low.
